This will be a loose simulation of how a bank will work. It will rely heavily on my understandings of using semaphores for synchronization and threading. There are three tellers, and all three must be ready for the bank to open. Tellers will handle the requests of customers. The customers that come to the bank will have one of two options, to either withdraw or desposit, and this is decided randomly when the customer is initialized. If there is a free teller, the customer can go to that teller, otherwise they will wait in line. The customers will communicate the transaction they want to fulfill to the teller. For a desposit, the teller must go into the safe, and only two tellers can be in there at a time. For a withdraw, a teller must get approval from a manager for that withdraw, and only one at a time. Once the transaction is done, the customer leaves and the teller signals the next one. After all 50 customers are done, the bank closes. Each teller and customer need a unique id. The teller must follow the exact sequence every time: declare it's ready, wait for customer, asks for transaction, receive transaction, get manager approval and wait a bit for it on a withdraw, go to the safe (wait if two tellers are there already), sleep for a bit to represent the transaction, tell the customer it is done, wait for customer to leave. The customer decides to withdraw or desposit randomly at the beginning, and then follows this sequence. wait 0-100ms, enter the bank, get in line (immediately go to teller if one is open), waits, give id (number), wait to ask for transaction, tell transaction, wait for teller to complete, leave bank. I will approach this first by declaring the global variables and semaphores. I will make variables for teller's availability, waiting, transactions being given, if the transaction is completed or not, customers leaving, the safe, the manager, the door to let in customers, and the remaining customers. These will all help to test and see if the bank is still open. I will make a log function to output to both the terminal and an output file. It will take a message from the customer or teller thread and will both print it out, and then write to a file. I will make two functions for the teller and customer thread, and fill it in with the appriopiate information at each point. I will have to think about this slowly and logically at first.
